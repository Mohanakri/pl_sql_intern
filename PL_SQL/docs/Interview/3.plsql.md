# Oracle PL/SQL Interview Questions & Answers (Definition ‚Üí Concept ‚Üí Scenario)

---

### Q1. Procedure vs Function
**Definition:**  
- A **procedure** is a named PL/SQL block that performs one or more actions. It may or may not return a value.  
- A **function** is a named PL/SQL block that must return exactly one value using the `RETURN` keyword.  

**Concept:**  
- Procedures are generally used for business logic and workflows (like inserts, updates, validations).  
- Functions are used for calculations and can be embedded in SQL queries.  
- Functions should ideally be free of side effects when used inside SQL.  

**Scenario:**  
I used a procedure to insert payroll records and validate salary ranges. I created a function to calculate tax percentage, which I called inside a SELECT query when generating salary reports.

---

### Q2. Cursors ‚Äî implicit, explicit, REF, `FOR UPDATE` / `WHERE CURRENT OF`, BULK COLLECT & FORALL
**Definition:**  
A **cursor** is a pointer to the memory area (context area) where Oracle stores the result of a SQL query.  

**Concept:**  
- **Implicit cursors**: Managed automatically by Oracle for single-row operations.  
- **Explicit cursors**: Declared by the developer for multi-row queries (`OPEN`, `FETCH`, `CLOSE`).  
- **REF cursors**: Cursor variables that can point to different queries (dynamic).  
- `FOR UPDATE` ‚Üí Locks rows when fetching, `WHERE CURRENT OF` ‚Üí allows updates/deletes on the fetched row.  
- **BULK COLLECT**: Fetch multiple rows at once into a collection.  
- **FORALL**: Perform DML in bulk using collections.  

**Scenario:**  
In ETL processing, I fetched 10,000 rows with BULK COLLECT and updated them using FORALL. This reduced runtime from hours to minutes.

---

### Q3. %TYPE vs %ROWTYPE
**Definition:**  
- `%TYPE`: Defines a variable with the datatype of a table column or another variable.  
- `%ROWTYPE`: Defines a record that can hold an entire row of a table or cursor.  

**Concept:**  
They make code schema-independent. If the column datatype changes, the PL/SQL code automatically adapts.  

**Scenario:**  
I declared `v_salary employees.salary%TYPE` to always match the salary column type. For fetching entire employee details, I used `emp_rec employees%ROWTYPE`.

---

### Q4. Triggers ‚Äî DML, DDL, Database, INSTEAD OF, Row vs Statement
**Definition:**  
A **trigger** is a stored PL/SQL block that executes automatically in response to specific database events.  

**Concept:**  
- **DML triggers**: Fire on `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`. Can be row-level or statement-level.  
- **DDL triggers**: Fire on schema events like `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`.  
- **Database triggers**: Fire on events like LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP.  
- **INSTEAD OF triggers**: Allow DML on complex views.  

**Scenario:**  
I created a row-level trigger on the `employees` table to log salary updates. I also created an INSTEAD OF trigger on a reporting view to insert data into multiple normalized tables.

---

### Q5. Mutating Table Error
**Definition:**  
A **mutating table error** occurs when a row-level trigger tries to read/modify the same table that fired it.  

**Concept:**  
Oracle raises this error to prevent inconsistent reads.  

**Fixes:**  
- Use statement-level or compound triggers.  
- Use package-level collections or staging tables.  
- Use PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION for logging only.  

**Scenario:**  
In a banking project, an update trigger on `accounts` failed due to mutating error. I fixed it using a compound trigger and package variable.

---

### Q6. Packages
**Definition:**  
A **package** is a schema object that groups procedures, functions, variables, cursors, and exceptions into one unit.  

**Concept:**  
- **Specification**: Public interface.  
- **Body**: Implementation.  
- Advantages: Encapsulation, reusability, performance (loaded once into memory).  

**Scenario:**  
I built a payroll package with procedures for salary insertion, bonus, and tax. It centralized business logic and reduced duplication.

---

### Q7. PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION
**Definition:**  
A **pragma** is a compiler directive. AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION makes a block run as an independent transaction.  

**Concept:**  
- Allows COMMIT/ROLLBACK inside a procedure, function, or trigger without affecting the main transaction.  
- Used for logging, auditing.  

**Scenario:**  
I created a log procedure with AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION so error logs were saved even if the payroll transaction rolled back.

---

### Q8. Exception Handling & RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR
**Definition:**  
Exceptions handle runtime errors in PL/SQL.  

**Concept:**  
- **Predefined exceptions**: NO_DATA_FOUND, TOO_MANY_ROWS, ZERO_DIVIDE, etc.  
- **User-defined exceptions**: Declared by developer.  
- `RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR`: Raise custom application errors (-20000 to -20999).  

**Scenario:**  
I handled `NO_DATA_FOUND` gracefully with a message, and raised custom exceptions for invalid salaries using `RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR`.

---

### Q9. Dynamic SQL ‚Äî EXECUTE IMMEDIATE vs DBMS_SQL
**Definition:**  
**Dynamic SQL** is SQL whose structure is not known until runtime.  

**Concept:**  
- `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`: Easy, supports bind variables, RETURNING INTO.  
- `DBMS_SQL`: Advanced, useful for fully dynamic queries.  
- Security: Always use binds and validate identifiers to avoid SQL injection.  

**Scenario:**  
I created a reporting tool where filters were dynamic. I used EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with bind variables for security.

---

### Q10. Collections ‚Äî Associative Arrays, Nested Tables, VARRAY
**Definition:**  
Collections are PL/SQL datatypes for storing multiple values.  

**Concept:**  
- **Associative arrays**: Key-value pairs, in-memory only.  
- **Nested tables**: Unordered, can be stored in DB.  
- **VARRAY**: Ordered, with a fixed maximum size.  

**Scenario:**  
I cached frequently accessed prices using associative arrays. For multi-tag storage, I used nested tables. For fixed lists like weekdays, I used VARRAYs.

---

### Q11. BULK COLLECT & FORALL
**Definition:**  
- **BULK COLLECT**: Fetch multiple rows into a collection at once.  
- **FORALL**: Perform bulk DML using a collection.  

**Concept:**  
They minimize context switches between SQL and PL/SQL.  

**Scenario:**  
I used BULK COLLECT + FORALL in ETL, cutting runtime from 3 hours to 20 minutes.

---

### Q12. Performance Tuning ‚Äî Techniques
**Definition:**  
Performance tuning optimizes PL/SQL for speed and efficiency.  

**Concept:**  
- Avoid row-by-row (slow by slow).  
- Use set-based SQL where possible.  
- Use indexes and partitions wisely.  
- Avoid SELECT *.  
- Analyze execution plans.  

**Scenario:**  
I replaced a cursor-based update with a MERGE. The runtime dropped drastically.

---

### Q13. Indexing
**Definition:**  
An **index** is a schema object that speeds up row retrieval.  

**Concept:**  
- **B-tree**: Default, good for high-cardinality.  
- **Bitmap**: Good for low-cardinality (DW).  
- **Function-based**: Index expressions.  
- **Composite**: Multi-column.  

**Scenario:**  
For a slow report query, I created a composite index `(cust_id, txn_date)`, reducing runtime from minutes to seconds.

---

### Q14. Execution Plans
**Definition:**  
An execution plan shows how Oracle executes a SQL query.  

**Concept:**  
- Use `EXPLAIN PLAN` or `DBMS_XPLAN`.  
- Look for full scans, join types, access paths.  

**Scenario:**  
I improved performance by creating an index, which changed a nested loop to a hash join.

---

### Q15. Tracing & Debugging
**Definition:**  
Tracing/debugging tools help identify errors and performance issues.  

**Concept:**  
- `DBMS_OUTPUT` for prints.  
- `DBMS_PROFILER` for performance profiling.  
- `DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_ERROR_BACKTRACE` for error stack.  
- TKPROF/SQL_TRACE for SQL-level tracing.  

**Scenario:**  
I used DBMS_PROFILER to locate a slow function and rewrote it with set-based SQL.

---

### Q16. SQL & PL/SQL Interaction
**Definition:**  
PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL, but crossing engines causes context switching.  

**Concept:**  
- Minimize switches with bulk operations.  
- Use bind variables for plan reuse.  

**Scenario:**  
Instead of executing 1000 small queries, I used BULK COLLECT in one query, reducing runtime.

---

### Q17. Joins & Subqueries
**Definition:**  
A **join** combines rows from multiple tables. A **subquery** is a query inside another query.  

**Concept:**  
- Joins are usually more efficient.  
- Correlated subqueries run per row, slower.  
- Use analytic functions or CTEs instead.  

**Scenario:**  
I replaced a correlated subquery with a CTE and join, reducing query runtime from 20 minutes to 2.

---

### Q18. Analytic Functions
**Definition:**  
Analytic functions return values based on groups of rows, without collapsing results.  

**Concept:**  
- `ROW_NUMBER()` ‚Üí Deduplication, pagination.  
- `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()` ‚Üí Ranking.  
- `LAG()`, `LEAD()` ‚Üí Compare rows.  

**Scenario:**  
I used LAG to compare customer spend month-over-month to detect unusual spikes.

---

### Q19. Bulk Data Loading ‚Äî SQL*Loader
**Definition:**  
SQL*Loader is a utility for high-speed data loading into Oracle.  

**Concept:**  
- Loads data from external files into tables.  
- Uses a control file to define mappings.  

**Scenario:**  
I used SQL*Loader to load daily sales CSV into staging tables in a retail project.

---

### Q20. Real-World Problem Scenarios
- **ETL Performance:** Replaced row-by-row load with BULK COLLECT + FORALL, cut runtime by hours.  
- **Mutating Trigger:** Fixed using compound trigger and package variables.  
- **Deadlocks:** Used `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and reduced transaction size.  

---

### Q21. Code Standards & Best Practices
**Definition:**  
Best practices ensure maintainable, reusable, and error-free code.  

**Concept:**  
- Clear naming conventions.  
- Modular code in packages.  
- Avoid hard-coded values.  
- Always handle exceptions.  
- Unit testing + peer reviews.  

**Scenario:**  
I introduced naming standards and pre-commit checks, reducing production bugs.

---

### Q22. Security in PL/SQL
**Definition:**  
PL/SQL must be secured against SQL injection and privilege misuse.  

**Concept:**  
- Use bind variables and DBMS_ASSERT.  
- Apply least privilege.  
- Use AUTHID DEFINER vs CURRENT_USER correctly.  

**Scenario:**  
I secured dynamic SQL with bind variables and DBMS_ASSERT, and moved sensitive operations to a restricted schema.

---

### Q23. Testing & Deployment
**Definition:**  
Controlled deployment reduces risk of production issues.  

**Concept:**  
- Keep code in version control.  
- Automate deployments with rollback.  
- Test in dev/test before prod.  

**Scenario:**  
I wrote rollback-capable scripts and automated unit tests, reducing deployment failures.

---

### Q24. Useful Quick Snippets

**FOR UPDATE / WHERE CURRENT OF**
```plsql
OPEN c FOR SELECT id, balance FROM accounts WHERE status='A' FOR UPDATE;
FETCH c INTO v_id, v_balance;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = v_balance - 100 WHERE CURRENT OF c;
CLOSE c;
```

**RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR**
```plsql
IF salary < 0 THEN
  RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Salary cannot be negative');
END IF;
```

**BULK COLLECT + FORALL**
```plsql
SELECT id, amount BULK COLLECT INTO l_recs FROM txns WHERE batch_id = v_batch;
FORALL i IN 1..l_recs.COUNT
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + l_recs(i).amount WHERE id = l_recs(i).id;
```
