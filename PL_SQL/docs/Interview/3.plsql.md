# PL/SQL Concepts Organized by Categories

## **FUNDAMENTALS**
| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **PL/SQL** | Procedural Language extension to SQL developed by Oracle. Combines SQL with procedural programming features like loops, conditions, and exception handling. |
| **Block Structure** | Basic unit of PL/SQL code consisting of DECLARE (optional), BEGIN (mandatory), EXCEPTION (optional), and END (mandatory) sections. |
| **Scope** | Visibility and accessibility of variables and other identifiers within different parts of the program. |
| **Lexical Scoping** | Rule that determines variable visibility based on where variables are declared in nested blocks. |
| **Label** | Named point in the code that can be referenced by GOTO statements or to name loops. |

## **VARIABLES AND DATATYPES**
| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Variable** | Named storage location that can hold data values. Must be declared with a specific datatype before use. |
| **Constant** | A variable whose value cannot be changed once assigned. Declared using the CONSTANT keyword. |
| **Datatype** | Defines the type of data that can be stored in a variable (NUMBER, VARCHAR2, DATE, BOOLEAN, etc.). |
| **%TYPE** | Attribute that allows a variable to inherit the datatype of a database column or another variable. |
| **%ROWTYPE** | Attribute that allows a variable to store an entire row from a table or cursor with the same structure. |
| **Record** | Composite datatype that groups related data items together, similar to a row in a table. |

## **CURSORS**
| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Cursor** | Pointer to a context area that holds the result set of a SQL query. Allows row-by-row processing of query results. |

## **CONTROL STRUCTURES**
| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Conditional Logic** | Control structures like IF-THEN-ELSE and CASE statements that execute code based on conditions. |
| **Loop** | Control structure that repeats a block of code. Types include LOOP, WHILE, and FOR loops. |

## **TRIGGERS**
| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Trigger** | Special PL/SQL block that automatically executes in response to specific database events. |
| **DML Trigger** | Trigger that fires in response to DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table. |
| **DDL Trigger** | Trigger that fires in response to DDL operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) on database objects. |
| **System Trigger** | Trigger that fires in response to database system events like startup, shutdown, or logon. |
| **OLD and NEW** | Correlation names used in DML triggers to reference old and new values of columns. |
| **Mutating Table** | Table that is being modified by a DML statement when a trigger tries to query or modify it. |

## **COLLECTIONS**
| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Collection** | Ordered group of elements of the same datatype. Types include VARRAY, Nested Table, and Associative Array. |
| **VARRAY** | Variable-size array with a maximum limit on the number of elements. |
| **Nested Table** | Unbounded, ordered collection of elements that can be stored in database tables. |
| **Associative Array** | Index-by table that uses string or integer indexes to access elements. |
