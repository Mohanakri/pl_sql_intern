# Day-to-Day Activities (Story Style)

In my project, my day usually starts with a **stand-up meeting** where I update the team on my progress and plan the dayâ€™s work.  
After that, I check **tickets and production logs** to see if any jobs or procedures have failed.  

Most of my time goes into **developing and enhancing PL/SQL objects** like procedures, functions, packages, and triggers to meet business requirements.  
I also work on **data loading using SQL*Loader** and design database objects such as tables and views when needed.  

Alongside development, I spend time **testing and debugging** the code, **optimizing queries** for better performance, and fixing any **production issues** reported by users.  
I also interact with **business analysts and clients** to clarify requirements and provide effort estimates.  

By the end of the day, I **update the task tracker, document the changes, and share my status** with the team.
